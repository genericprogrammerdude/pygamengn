# pygamengn

A game engine built on [pygame-ce](https://pyga.me/). This engine is developed for fun and in the best shooting-from-the-hip coding tradition, with limited thought put into the design of its components (although it's worth mentioning that the author has 15+ years experience in game development). Expect little.

## Dependencies

### [pygame-ce](https://pyga.me/)
### [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/ "NumPy")

## Running Samples

After ensuring that all dependencies are installed in your system, you can run the AsteroidShooter sample from your command line:

```
$ cd [pygamengn dir]/Samples/AsteroidShooter/src
$ python3 main.py
```

Alternatively, you can load the `pygamengn` directory in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). There are launch configurations for each of the samples.
